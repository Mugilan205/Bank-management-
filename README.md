A console-based Java DBMS Bank Management Project is an application designed to manage basic banking operations through a text-based user interface. The project utilizes Java for core application logic, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL (or another RDBMS) for persistent data storage. This project is ideal for learning fundamental concepts in Java programming, database interaction, and object-oriented principles. Here’s a high-level overview:

Features:

Account Management:

Supports the creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of bank accounts.
Different account types, such as Savings and Checking, can be managed with distinct interest rates and minimum balances.
Transaction Management:

Allows deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations, updating account balances accordingly.
Each transaction is logged with details such as amount, date, and transaction type for transparency and record-keeping.
Balance Inquiry:

Customers can check their current account balance.
Transaction History:

Provides a list of past transactions for each account, with filtering options by date or transaction type.
Database Integration:

Uses MySQL for storing data related to customers, accounts, and transactions.
Database tables are normalized for efficiency and data integrity, with foreign keys to link customers and accounts.
Admin Features:

Allows authorized staff to manage accounts and view reports on total deposits, total withdrawals, and account statistics.
Core Technologies:
Java: Used for the application’s main functionality, including input handling, data processing, and error management.
JDBC: Enables communication between the Java application and the MySQL database.
MySQL: Stores persistent data for accounts, customers, transactions, and audit logs.
Object-Oriented Design: Classes like Account, Customer, Transaction,organize functionality in a structured manner.
